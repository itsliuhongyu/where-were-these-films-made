    "## Working with Mapbox GL JS\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapbox GL JS is a JavaScript library/API\n",
    "that allows you to make interactive maps that includes shapes, markers, pop-up windows and many other built-in interactive capabilities. But, because it's written in JavaScript and running the browser, anyone with knowledge of JavaScript can extend its capabilities as far as that knowledge can take them. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is most important to us is that \"data\" can be attached to these maps via **geojson format**--making the map, and the rest of the browser an interface for the reader to explore and engage with the output of your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your final projects--the real goal is producing successful, thoughtful, meaningful **output** (that is, dataframes!) that can be explored through the map. More on the specific output you'll need in a moment: first, in basics about JavaScript and Mapbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript\n",
    "JavaScript is the programming language that was invented in order to make webpages interactive. JavaScript is an odd and quirky language--it began as a necessity for scripting events on web browsers, and now it has been extended in many directions beyond even the browser. There are many JavaScript tutorials out there -- https://www.w3schools.com/js/ is the most basic, and a decent place to start. With your knowledge of Python you could certainly learn JavaScript via tutorials, books like *Javascript & JQuery, interactive front-end web development*, by Jon Duckett, sites/books like http://eloquentjavascript.net/, and, of course, by patrolling stack overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few basic things to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "-All lines in JavaScript are supposed to end with the semi-colon  `;`\n",
    "Not everyone follows this standard, but that's what you're supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "-All variables must be initialized/declared using one of the following keywords: `var`, `let`, or `const` (each have a different meaning)\n",
    "\n",
    "-All functions, loops, if statements etc. are enclosed in brackets `{ }`\n",
    "For example, here's a JavaScript loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "for (let i=0; i < 10; i++) {\n",
    "   console.log(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the JavaScript loop through an array (Python list):\n",
    "\n",
    "`const daysofWeek = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];`\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "for (let i=0; i < daysofWeek.length; i++) {\n",
    "   console.log(daysofWeek[i])\n",
    "}\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**JavaScript console** Notice the `console.log()`, that is the JavaScript version of `print()` The runtime environment for JavaScript is the browser. The console is the JavaScript console that is part of the browser's developer tools. Go to Chrome and select:\n",
    "\n",
    "`View:Developer:JavaScript Console`\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can cut-and-paste each of those loops into the console and run it. The console is very helpful for debugging JavaScript. When you have errors on the the page, the console tells you where they are by line number (or tries to), and you can also log variables into the console to make sure everything is working in your script. **If you try to load your map, you should always check the JavaScript console if you have any trouble.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot more to know about JavaScript, if you want to learn it. Here a few random things to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Indentations are meaningless in JavaScript (but it's good to use them so your code can be read clearly by a human)\n",
    "\n",
    "-JavaScript is a messy language, it tries not to be type-specific: so it will automatically convert numerical variables into strings and back--unless it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "-JavaScript tries not to break--if one part of the script breaks it tries to keep the page going, so sometimes it's hard to debug. \n",
    "\n",
    "-JavaScript cares about the DOM -- it reads the page for elements and allows you to change their contents, styles, and lots of other things. For really robust browser-page effects, you should use the Jquery library--it's like short-hand, superpowered JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "-As I'm sure you all know by now, \"lists\" in Python are \"arrays\" in JavaScript, \"dictionaries\" in Python are \"objects\" in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Finally: **you do not need to learn JavaScript to complete this project.** I have built templates that will allow you to build a geojson file that will plug into the mapbox GL page with only a little bit of work and custom changes.\n"

    "## MAPS ON SCREEN\n",
    "\n",
    "### SCREEN SPACE\n",
    "This is the space on the browser, and the screen is measured on an X/Y axis. All of the placement of elements on the screen have a location on these coordinates. The top left-hand corner of the browser is at (x:0,y:0). The further to the right you go the more pixels 'x' is. The further down you go the more pixels 'y' is. To get an idea of locations try this page: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_event_mouse_clientxy2\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing that a library like Mapbox GL https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/\n",
    "does is translate longitudes and latitudes into screen space...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Templates\n",
    "There are two templates that I am providing for this project. I have created them so you can go very far with almost no customization at all. There are two main templates available on courseworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "`map_shapes_template.zip\n",
    "&\n",
    "map_points_template.zip`\n",
    "\n",
    "These both contain two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "`map.html\n",
    "geo-data.js`\n",
    "\n",
    "`map.html` contains all of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript to display the map can make it interactive. How much you want to customize the styles, layout, etc is completely optional. You may not even touch this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`geo-data.js` contains the geojson document that you will export from your data frames. 95% of the work is in building this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the map\n",
    "In mapbox there is one main function that creates the map: It sets the position, zoom and the tiles. In all likelihood this is the only thing you will need to edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tvar map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n",
    "\t\t\tcontainer: 'map',\n",
    "\t\t\tstyle: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v10',\n",
    "\t\t\tcenter: [0, 0],\n",
    "\t\t\tzoom: 11,\n",
    "\t\t\tprojection: 'naturalEarth'\n",
    "\t\t});\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "'new mapboxgl.Map({' is where the map first is constructed. 'var map' is the container (variable) that holds the map that you're constructing. The rest of the properties (keys) define different aspects of the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projections\n",
    "Over the past year or so Mapbox has implemented different projections. These allow us to move away from Mercator projections which warp the size of countries unacceptably. Both of the templates default to use the 'naturalEarth' projection, which is more accurate. If your map is zoomed in, you might want to consider removing the projection property (above) and return it the map to Mercator, so that the area you're displaying is flatter. For more on projections:\n",
    "https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/projections/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positioning your map\n",
    "To make your mapbox project work, you only need to make some small changes on the HTML page (your main goal is generating the proper output for geojson--I'll get to that soon). First here are a few things that you can do to the HTML/Mapbox code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Center your map and choose your zoom:\n",
    "`\n",
    "center: [-21.9270884, 64.1436456], \n",
    "zoom: 11\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "Those properties `center` and `zoom` tell the browser what longitude and latitude you want the map to be centered on `[-21.9270884, 64.1436456]`, and the next number is the zoom level `11`. 0 zoom is the whole world, around 12 you start zooming in on a city, after 20 you start getting very very close to the street. `map_points_template` uses the  method .fitBounds() that automatically sets your map's center and zoom--which can be super helpful or make things more complicated--see the template code for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tons of ways of using and extending Mapbox GL JS. Here are links to examples which might be helpful but probably a rabbit hole, and the actual API documentation which I suggest you don't read until next semester:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tiles\n",
    "What are tiles? Tiles are the background images that are displayed on an interactive screen map. If you have ever gone to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), you may have noticed that the world according to Google has a particular look and feel to it--very tan, green and blue. This is the default design for Google Maps' tiles. Notice how when you zoom in or move the mouse around, there is an empty gray space before the details of the map show up (if you internet connection is fast you might not see the blank tiles). These are tiles: different illustrations of maps that have been created for various levels of zoom, for every part of the earth. Your browser doesn't download all of them at once--that would be a huge download. Instead, these images of the earth are split up into small tiles and served dynamically to you depending on what you're looking at (what level of zoom, and what geographic location).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages and limitations to Mapbox is that it serves tiles--so your maps can work just like Google Maps. The problem of course is that these tiles greatly influence the look and feel of your map. There are and handful of free tiles that Mapbox provides. (And if you are a designer, and have a lot of time on your hands, you can custom-make tiles in Mapbox--do not do this for this project!!!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose your tiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "`style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v11'`\n",
    "\n",
    "This line lets you access a free tile library from MapBox, are other free tiles include:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#styles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access token\n",
    "Like many APIs Mapbox requires that you have access token and register. Please register and get your own access token here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to make a public token for this project, but please do rather than use the one that's already in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've made your access token replace this line with your code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n",
    "\t\tmapboxgl.accessToken = 'your_code';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the super basics--you can go a lot deeper on your own if you want to pursue this project beyond the next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OUTPUT!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this is really what matters the next week. You are now scraping cleaning and aggregating your data. The question will be, **what do you want people to see?** Here are the main categories you need to focus on in order to get the output you need.  All of these outputs will be constructed in Python, and exported to geojson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## geojson\n",
    "\n",
    "The **geojson format** is a standardized form of JSON (JavaScript object notation)--specifically set up to be read by mapping programs (not just Mapbox but all mapping programs). The main thing to understand is that each point or shape on a map is considered a feature. Each feature is held in an array (list) called featuresCollection. Each feature has two important properties (keys)--**geometry**, which contains the longitude and latitude as well as type of shape-- and **properties**, which attaches any additional data to that shape. Here's a simple example of a feature:\n",
    "`\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"type\": \"Feature\",\n",
    "\"properties\": {\"party\": \"Democrat\"},\n",
    "\"geometry\": {\n",
    "\"type\": \"Polygon\",\n",
    "\"coordinates\": [[\n",
    "[-109.05, 41.00],\n",
    "[-102.06, 40.99],\n",
    "[-102.03, 36.99],\n",
    "[-109.04, 36.99],\n",
    "[-109.05, 41.00]\n",
    "]]\n",
    "}\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "For your project it is the properties that are 95% of the challenge--but you will need some geometry so that you have interactive shapes on your map.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometry\n",
    "This is critical to building your GEOJSON object--**geometry** is the property that uses longitude and latitude to plot points or draw shapes on the map. What kind of geometry will you need? There are two aspects of geometry you need to decide on--first what geographical level are you studying (Country, State, City, Address), and second, what kind of shape do you need?\n",
    "\n",
    "The two templates for this project do imply that you have to make a choice between to main categories of shapes: **polygons** or **points**. Polygons are shapes like the shape of the state or a country. Points are specific locations (like an address) defined by a single set of longitude and latitude. (Usually these different categories of shapes imply different levels of knowledge. You can try to combine them for the project, and the templates may or may not behave...) Most of you will need polygons and multi polygons for Country/State level projects. Some of you will need points (which is simple latitude and longitude). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a Mapbox example of what shapes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/geojson-polygon/\n",
    "\n",
    "But rather than reading a boring tutorial, let's just make some shapes! For a class today we are going to build a very quick point map, and make it work in the points template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to this site, and make some points:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://geojson.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "This site allows you to dynamically construct a geojson document. Zoom into whatever you like and start making points. As you might begin to understand as you build your random point map, the real trick with a program like mapbox is that it translates longitude and latitude coordinates to the X and Y grid of the screen space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have constructed your document's geometry, you can now add the properties from our template:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{\"article\": \"<p>text</p>\", \"radius\":7, \"color\": \"#FFFF00\", \"group_id\": 1, \"group_name\": \" \", \"headline\":\"\", \"name\": \" \"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "While geometry is critical, at this point you only need to know which kind of geometry you'll need--the last step of your project should be locating shapefiles/lng-lats and merging them with your output data that will all be in the \"properties\" object/dictionary of your final geojson document. (Today's later tutorials begin to take you through those exact steps.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties \n",
    "This is what you should be focusing on building. As you will see, there are only about four or five dictionary keys that you need to build. But you need to build them well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Informational properties\n",
    "**name:** State/Country/City/Court district--the main unit of study/geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "**headline:** a simple short summary of the information attached to the layer (State/City/Point)--like a headline. This will appear in the pop-up window when you roll over a layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**article:** text displayed in the browser, outside of the map--this can be an entire article in HTML. This text will be displayed when you click on a layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual grouping properties\n",
    "**color:** in a hexadecimal (\"#660066\") or RGB (\"rgb(120,0,120)\") string -- for more on defining colors, check this out: https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/\n",
    "Think about how many colors do you need, and what kind of colors would be the most representative, appropriate, effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rating:** This is an alternate to using 'color:' You can specify a numerical range and specify numbers between that range, and the mapbox template will automatically generate a proper color based on the range (Soma made this!). If you want to use this you may need to edit some of the JavaScript here:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "paint: {\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "And go to Soma's explanation of how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://gist.github.com/jsoma/c91cfa7a1f4f8346d95ac2a907f0cb0c\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**radius**: This only works with points geometry. You can set the radius of each point in pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**group_id:** and **groud_name:** different groupings of data to be displayed separately as multiple layers on the map--this will allow you to display/study multiple aspects of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### geojson row:\n",
    "Here's an example one row in geojson format that will work with the template:\n",
    "`\n",
    "{\n",
    "      \"type\": \"Feature\",\n",
    "      \"properties\":{ \"name\": \"My House\", \"group_name\": \"best\", \"group_id\": 1, \"headline\": \"home\", \"article\": \"<p>What I like about my house is ...,<\\/p>\", \"color\": \"#660000\", \"radius\": \"7\" },\n",
